# Discourse Updater Playbook
[discourse-updater.yml](https://github.com/pacharanero/ansible-discourse/blob/master/discourse-updater.yml) will update an Ubuntu Server and then update Discourse using the Pull from GitHub, `./launcher rebuild app` method, finishing by cleaning up stopped Docker containers and then rebooting the server.
